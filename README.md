This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) that is a waiting list app that is connected to the brevo api. It collects Name, email and answers to a couple questions adds it all in Brevo where you can then add an automation to send an email to new potential leads.

This next js app is created by Fred Trivett and is hosted at [Early Grovy](https://early.growvy.app/)

Growvy is a side project I am working on that is going to be a platform to learn business.

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
